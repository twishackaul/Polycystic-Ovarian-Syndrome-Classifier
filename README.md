## Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Classifier

### Polycystic-ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal condition characterised by signs and symptoms of elevated androgens, irregular menstruation, and polycystic ovaries. Worldwide, 11–13% of women suffer from PCOS, resulting in a substantial health and economic burden globally. Co-morbidities due to PCOS include the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors such as excess weight, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. 
### Additionally, there is an increased risk of pregnancy complications, including early miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia, as well as a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer.
### Women with PCOS also experience a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction, and negative body image.
### This project presents an application for classifying PCOS using ultrasound imaging and clinical data. 
### Initially, a deep learning model was developed to diagnose PCOS based on clinical data alone and achieved 90.18% accuracy using the CatBoost classifier. 
### A fusion model was proposed that integrates clinical data and ultrasound imaging to enhance diagnostic accuracy. A CNN model was developed, achieving an accuracy of 93.96%. Two additional CNN models followed this in conjunction with Transfer Learning – Inception V3, which achieved an accuracy of 95.89%, and ResNet 50, which attained an accuracy of 99.32%.
### The fusion model, based on the combination of the CatBoost classifier and ResNet, achieved an accuracy of ---.
